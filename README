Gather is a micro-framework for gathering results from concurrent requests.

Whenever a value is provided to the Gather, it will attempt to match the highest priority candidates. If any
are satisfied, the gather completes and invokes that candidate. If no top-priority candidate is matched before
the timeout, then it works is way down the priorities until a candidate is matched. If no candidate is matched it
completes with a TimeOutException.
